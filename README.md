In addition to the announced requirements, the following has been implemented 

Added animation for buttons when changing status

The side menu has 3 versions: 

default,

for tablet 

(in this version, the open/close buttons work for me using a java script),

for the phone
(in this version, hovering over the menu icon and the tooltip are implemented using css)
